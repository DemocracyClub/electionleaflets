3) Settings and database
```

# create a postgres db, and update settings in local.py

```
also you may need:

mkdir -p electionleaflets/media/uploads/{thumbnail,small,medium,large}

Create a database and a user in Postgres, then edit the local.py file and add details of your database.

Then run database migration & setup cach tables

## Notes from version 1.0

### Welcome

Welcome, this is a port to Django of the PHP election leaflets application which can be found at http://code.google.com/p/theelectionleafletproject/.

In order to speed up this port, we are running the very first version with the original database structure and aiming to move to refined version over time as new functionality is added that requires a tidy up in a particular area. This shouldn't make a big difference if you are building from scratch it helped me out lots with all of the existing data.

### Upcoming functionality

* Users


### Future TODO List

A list of things outside of upcoming features that need doing to make this more useful outside of the UK.

 * Provide translations of the templates
 * Use local flavors for checking postcodes/zipcodes
 * Allow for multi-tenant hosting of sites for various languages

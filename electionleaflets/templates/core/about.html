<h1>About ElectionLeaflets.org</h1>

<p>Electioneering is a high-stakes game. We, at ElectionLeaflets.org, believe
that itâ€™s time for that game to become a spectator sport.</p>

<p>ElectionLeaflets.org is a real-time election leaflet project. Our ambition
is to create a live visualization of the flood of party political leaflets as
they are delivered across the country during an election campaign.</p>

<p>If you have recently received any election leaflets through your door you
can help by photographing or scanning them and uploading the images.</p>

      <h1>About ElectionLeaflets.org</h1>

      <p>Electioneering is a high-stakes game. We, at ElectionLeaflets.org, believe
      that it’s time for that game to become a spectator sport.</p>

      <p>ElectionLeaflets.org is a real-time election leaflet project. Our ambition
      is to create a live visualization of the flood of party political leaflets as
      they are delivered across the country during an election campaign.</p>

      <p>If you have recently received any election leaflets through your door you
      can help by photographing or scanning them and uploading the images to our
      server.</p>

      <p>The idea was conjured up in December 2008 at a weekend in Derbyshire, and
      finally acted upon in Francis's front living room in Cambridge at the end of
      April 2009.</p>

      <p>The original name of the website was "The Straight Choice", derived from a
      leaflet in the controversial by-election in Bermondsey in 1983 which has become
      the type specimen of accusations of dodgy campaigning. We renamed the site
      "ElectionLeaflets.org" in August 2010. It is currently being supported by
      Unlock Democracy, the campaign for democracy, rights and freedoms, and
      Democracy Club. Election Leaflets, Unlock Democracy and Democracy Club are
      independent and not affiliated to any political party</p>

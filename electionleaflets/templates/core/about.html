    <h1>About</h1>

    <p>ElectionLeaflets.org is an open archive of the literature published by political parties and candidates during UK
        election campaigns.</p>

    <p>One-third of all spending during UK elections goes towards printing election leaflets. Leaflets are the most
        common way voters learn about their candidates. </p>
    <p>This website ensures that this otherwise ephemeral literature is captured for journalists, analysts, and
        historians to use now and in the future.</p>
    <p>If you have recently received any election leaflets through your door you
        can help by photographing or scanning them and uploading the images.</p>
